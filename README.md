# Besag-York-Mollie

The BYM Model is a lognormal Poisson distribution developed for disease-risk mapping which includes both an Integrated Conditional Auto-Regression Model (ICAR) component for spatial smoothing and an ordinary random effects component for non-spatial heterogeneity. It is used to project statistical findings in order to analyze the degree of risk and discern details about the provided dataset.

### Prerequisites

Python
	-pip
		o Package manager for installing software packages for Python
	-pystan
		o Used for the interface between Stan and Python to 
	-arviz
		o Used for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models 
	- numpy
	- pandas
	- pathlib
	- random

The software packages can all be downloaded locally using the package manager pip within a command line prompt.
